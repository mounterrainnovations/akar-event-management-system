# Part 2: Competitive Landscape

## 2. Regional Competitors: Indian Event Platforms

General event platforms in India that NGOs often use due to local payment support.

| Platform      | Strengths                                    | Weaknesses                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explara**   | Good local payment support, marketing tools. | Dated interface, lacks specific NGO features (donations/80G). |
| **Ticmint**   | Modern UI, flexible ticketing.               | Newer player, less established trust.                         |
| **Dreamcast** | Strong branding, hybrid event support.       | Expensive, complex setup.                                     |
| **FunZippy**  | Free ticketing options.                      | Very basic features, limited analytics.                       |

## 3. Indirect Competitors: EdTech for Women

Organizations offering similar educational services but lacking the integrated event management aspect.

- **Nirmaan (Women in Tech):** Strong training programs but relies on basic forms for registration.
- **Anudip Foundation:** Excellent ground operations but weak digital platform for public interaction.
- **HerKey:** Career-focused platform for women, but not designed for NGO operations or fundraising.

## 4. Strategic Gap Analysis

### What Competitors Do Well

- **Ticketing:** Robust flows for paid/free tickets.
- **Payments:** Integration with standard payment gateways.
- **Basic CRM:** Tracking attendee lists and broad donor data.

### Missing Features (The Opportunity)

Most competitors differ from the specific needs of an Indian EdTech NGO in key areas:

1.  **Integrated LMS (Learning Management):** Competitors are either "Event Platforms" or "Course Platforms". None combine **Events + Courses** effectively for NGOs.
2.  **Indian Context:** Lack of native support for **UPI payments** and **WhatsApp notifications** in global platforms.
3.  **Beneficiary Impact Tracking:** Event platforms track _attendance_, but not _long-term impact_ on a beneficiary's life (empowerment, employment).
4.  **Volunteer Lifecycle:** Volunteer management is often an afterthought or a separate expensive tool.
5.  **Compliance Automation:** Lack of automated **80G tax receipt** generation standard in Indian donation flows.
6.  **Government Scheme Integration:** No ability to tag events/programs to specific government missions for reporting.

## 5. Unique Value Proposition

Akar's platform will differentiate itself by being **India's first unified platform** that combines:

1.  **Event Management** (Workshops, Drives)
2.  **EdTech Delivery** (Courses, Certifications)
3.  **Comprehensive Impact Tracking** (Beneficiary progress)

This "All-in-One" approach tailored for the Indian NGO ecosystem addresses the fragmentation currently forcing NGOs to use 3-4 different disconnected tools.
